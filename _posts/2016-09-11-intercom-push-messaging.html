  <h3>A light weight way to engage your mobile users</h3>
  <p>Push only messaging is a new type of message Intercom customers can send to their users, this message type allows customers to send their mobile users a push notification only rather than a push notification and a message. The most common types of messages this medium is used for are; messages to promote a new feature and app status updates.</p>
  <h3>Why we built it</h3>
  <p>Intercom’s mobile customers needed the ability for a push notification to be the whole message, before a push notification from Intercom was a sign post for the message to open the Intercom inbox.</p>
